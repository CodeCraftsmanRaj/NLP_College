Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to understand its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly—even in real time. There is a good chance you have interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) Library is a suite that contains libraries and programs for statistical language processing. It is one of the most powerful NLP libraries, which contains packages to make machines understand human language and reply to it with an appropriate response. Learning Natural Language Toolkit will help you add an extra skill and also enhance your knowledge of NLP. Learning the NLTK library is also beneficial for enhancing careers in AI and Natural Language Processing with Python.
